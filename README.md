# multi-agent_pacmen_simulation
This project implements a "Multi-Agent System (MAS)" based on the "Pac-Man" environment, where three autonomous agents (Pac-Men) compete and cooperate to collect pellets within a maze. The key challenge lies in "shared corridor conflicts", where agents must negotiate traversal rights through decentralized decision-making.
